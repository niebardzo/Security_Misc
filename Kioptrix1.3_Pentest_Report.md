# Application Penetration Testing Report Kioptrix-v1.3


## Intoduction and Objectives

The application penetration testing report contains efforts that were conducted in order to find vulnerabilities, which a threat actor can use to gain control over the web application. For the scope of this penetration test, the web application was deployed in the Virualized Enviorement with no additional information about the system.

IP address: **192.168.23.131**

The assumption with severity calculation was made that the system is intended to go public soon.

## Summary


### High-Level Summary

This chapter presents the high overview of the results found during the application penetration test.
The chart and table below presents the findings with the coresponding severity.

![VULN_SEV_KIOPTRIX](../master/static/barchart_kioptrix.png)

Vulnerabilities with critical severity allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the system or to leak  data with extremly high likehood to exploit e.g. Internet facing application without authentication. Vulnerabilities with severity high allow the attacker to take over the account, leak data with relativly high likelihood to exploit. Vulnerabilities with severity medium can lead to eavasdropping of the communication between client and application, secret leakage and denial of service. Vulnerabilities with severity low can assist in exploitation of higher severity vulnerabilities.
For further reading there were CWE-ID provided.


|No.|Vulnerability									|Severity		|CWE-ID		|
|---|-------------									|--------		|------		|
|1	|SQL Injection									|**Critical**	|CWE-89		|
|2	|Local File Inclusion							|**High** 		|CWE-98		|
|3	|Weak Passwords									|Medium			|CWE-521	|
|4	|Cleartext Storage of Passwords					|Medium			|CWE-312	|
|5	|Unecnrypted communication						|Medium			|CWE-319	|
|6	|HTTP TRACE Enabled								|Low			|CWE-749	|
|7	|Anti-Clickjacking not presents					|Low			|CWE-1021	|
|8	|Cookie without httponly flag					|Low			|CWE-1004	|
|9	|Information exposure through directory path	|Low			|CWE-200	|

For the detailed description of each vulnerability, please refer to CWE-ID.


### Detailed Summary

This chapter presents the detailed summary of vulnerable endpoints. The chapter is more dedicated to technical people who are interested in remediation process. Table below presents the vulnerable HTTP endpoints with the HTTP method, parameters and Body.


|No.|Vulnerable Endpoint	|HTTP METHOD|Params			|Body										  	 |
|---|-------------------	|-----------|------			|----											 |
|1	|/checklogin.php		|POST		|-   			|myusername=test&mypassword=**test**&Submit=Login|
|2	|/member.php			|GET		|**username**	|-												 |

For remaining vulnerabilities, there are no vulnerable parameters or body but weakness lays in webserver configuration, HTTP header or general policy.

**Numbers 3 and 4** - refers to weak password policy

**Number 5** - Unecrypted communication refers to sending sensitive data (username and password) over unencrypted channel. When implementing the encryption in transit, appropiate HTTP headers should be set up to ensure the strong configuration of Http over tls. The details can be found in Recommendation chapter.

**Number 6** - HTTP Trace Enabled refers to HTTP method (Trace) that refelects the input send by the user. The vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass native browser cookie protection (if in place e.g. httponly), to leak the senstive cookie by Cross-site scripting attack.

**Number 7** - vulnerability allows the attacker to render content of the website in the context of other domain owned by attacker. Unless intended as functionallity, appropiate HTTP Header has to be set up to limit the rendering of the website in different browser context.

**Number 8** - the cookie missing httponly flag which in case of Cross-site scripting attack allow the attacker to easly hijack the cookie and take over user session.

**Number 9** - the information is exposed through the directory names in the web application.

## Methodology

The testing methodology used was based on OWASP Applcation Security Verification Standard 4.0


### Information Gathering & Service Enumeration

To idetify the open ports and running services the nmap scan was run with NSE scripts.

There are 4 tcp ports open on the machine. On port 22 tcp there is ssh service running. Port 80 tcp, exposed and outdated apache server running. On ports 139 and 445 tcp, there is Samba SMB service running. Also, nmap has identified the operating system version as Linux kernel 2.6. The next target would be the http service on port 80 tcp.

At this moment the nikto scan has idetify the following vulnerabilities: communication is not encrypted (number 5), HTTP Trace method is active (number 6), Anti-clickjacking header is not present (number 7), Cookie PHPSESSID created without the httponly flag (number 8).

Also please note that nikto discover **outdated** version of PHP and Apache.

The valueable information from the dirb scan is that potentially there is a user **john** register in the web application which corresponds to **number 9** vulnerability.

### Testing and Exploitation

Further testing will be handled on the http website running on port 80 tcp. Then the communication was intercepted with the usage of local web proxy **Burp Suite**.
