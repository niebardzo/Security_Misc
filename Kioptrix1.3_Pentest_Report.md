## Intoduction and Objectives

The application security penetration testing report contains efforts that were conducted in order to find vulnerabilities, which a threat actor can use to gain control over the web application. For the scope of this penetration test, the web application was deployed in the Virualized Enviorement with no additional information about the system.

IP address: 192.168.23.131

The assumption with severity calculation was made that the system is intended to go public soon.

## Summary


### High-Level Summary

This chapter presents the high overview of the results found during the application security penetration test.
The chart and table below presents the findings with the coresponding severity.

(CHART)

Vulnerabilities with critical severity allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the system or to leak  data with extremly high likehood to exploit e.g. Internet facing application without authentication. Vulnerabilities with severity high allow the attacker to take over the account, leak data with relativly high likelihood to exploit. Vulnerabilities with severity medium can lead to eavasdropping of the communication between client and application, secret leakage and denial of service. Vulnerabilities with severity low can assist in exploitation of higher severity vulnerabilities.


|Vulnerability					|Severity	|
|-----							|----		|
|SQL Injection					|HIGH		|
|Clickjacking					|LOW		|
|Cookie without httponly flag	|LOW		|
